Greetins, Program!

I have set up this repository to hold the project files I will be working with while in the MVC track of the
San Diego Tech Immersion Group (http://sdtig.com/).
The project, PartyInvites, is a working example from the book: "Pro ASP.NET MVC 4", the book we are using for
the next few months of the track.
